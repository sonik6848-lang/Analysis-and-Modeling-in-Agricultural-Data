# IIT Kanpur CS685: Data Mining end semester project: Indian Agriculture Analysis

### Introduction
This project uses several data mining techniques to extract information from agriculture
data and to give suggestions regarding crops and make future predictions so that agriculture
can be carried out in a planned manner. The objectives of the project include-
1. Finding trends in crops in terms of production, area, etc. over the years and studying
the reasons behind the changing trends.
2. Finding how different factors that affect production are related to each other.
3. Prediction of suicide rate of the farmers.
4. Study of crops that do not follow the general trends and show an abnormal trend such
as reduction in production.
5. Finding similar crops and similar states based on various factors.
6. Predictions of crops that might be rarely produced and the main crops that might be
preferred by the farmers.
